# Telecom-Churn-Case-Study

Background:
In the telecom industry, customers can choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one
operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of
15-25% annual churn rate. It costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing
one, customer retention has now become more important than customer acquisition.
Problem Statement:
In the prepaid model, customers who want to switch to another network can simply stop using the services without
any notice, and it is hard to know whether someone has actually churned or is simply not using the services
temporarily. Thus, churn prediction is usually more critical (and non-trivial) for prepaid customers, and the
term ‘churn’ should be defined carefully.
Goal:
Retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies
need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
